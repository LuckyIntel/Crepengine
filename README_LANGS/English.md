## What is Crepengine and it's Features
### Crepengine is a 2 dimensional game engine that works with the terms Stage and Actor. Crepengine uses Ortographic projection for it's projection matrix. It's made with WebGL 1 (OpenGL ES 2.0) graphics library.
### Crepengine is a free-ware and uses MIT License as it's license.
## How to use Crepengine
### Simply download the Crepengine.js and add it to your HTML file, just like I did in the examples folder. After you add the Crepengine.js to your HTML file, you're going to simply add another script to the HTML file. You should add the other script after the Crepengine.js, not before it. After it's done, simply open the script file you added to the HTML file for the game codes, type this code in it `const Stage = Crepengine();` and you're done. Now you can use every function of the Crepengine.
### WARNING: I didn't actually had a chance to test "signImage" function so beware that it can go wrong with the images you use!
